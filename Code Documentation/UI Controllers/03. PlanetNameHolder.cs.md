# PlanetNameHolder.cs

*This class is automatically attached to each planet's name text*

## Variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Planet | Game object of the planet on which PlanetController is attached to |
| PlanetController | GravityObject from which text was created, assigned itself on [create void](../Gravity%20Controllers/01.%20GravityObject.cs.md#void-createplanetnameholder) |
| SmoothSpeed | Value of smoothness speed, customizable. *Default value is ``0.02f``* |
| controller | Global [GravityObjectsController](../Gravity%20Controllers/02.%20GravityObjectsController.cs.md) |
| _transform | Planet's name text' rect transform |
| textPos | Position where text should be (doesn't need to be always, especially when is smooth following ) |

## void Start

Here we assign Planet game object, finding controller, _transform and we're setting size of the text field.

## void LateUpdate

Here we udpate textPos, which is actually position of empty game object (children of the planet).

Then we are following easy if statement:

| If game is paused | Action |
| --- | ----------- |
| False | We're just setting position of text to textPos |
| True | We're calling [SmoothFollow void](./03.%20PlanetNameHolder.cs.md#void-smoothfollow) for make  smoother positioning text to the textPos

## void SmoothFollow

Here we're just setting position of the text using [Lerp function](https://gamedevsolutions.com/what-is-lerp-in-unity/) and SmoothSpeed value.
