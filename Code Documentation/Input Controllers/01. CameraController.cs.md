# CameraController.cs

*This class is attached to camera controller game object*

## Variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Sensivity | Sensivity of mouse dragging, higher value = faster camera movement *(default value: 0.1)* |
| mainCamera | Camera component on game object tagged *"MainCamera" |
| cameraGO | Game object on which main camera is attached |
| pointerStartPos | Pointer position at the moment of start of mouse dragging |
| scaler | Vector by which we need to move pointer start position to camera start position, similar to [moveVector](../Gravity%20Controllers/01.%20GravityObject.cs.md#void-onmousedown)|

## void Start

Here we're just setting up mainCamera and cameraGO.

## void Update

So here we're checking two things:

* If right mouse button is pressed (returns true only when clicked):  
If it's true, we're setting pointerStartPos and scaler to right values.
* If right mouse button is down (returns true while the user holds down right mouse button):
If it's true, we're calling [MoveCamera void.](./01.%20CameraController.cs.md#void-movecamera)

## void MoveCamera

*called by [void update in CameraController.cs](./01.%20CameraController.cs.md#void-update)*  
*works similar to [void OnMouseDrag in gravityObject](../Gravity%20Controllers/01.%20GravityObject.cs.md#void-onmousedrag)*

Here we're changing camera position with scaler and sensivity with "formula" below:

When user starts dragging he can click in some weird position on screen like ``(700, 60, 0)``. So in that position our camera position should be start position f.e. ``(0, 0, -10)``. So our fixed mouse position is:  
``mouse position + scaler``  
where scaler is vector that we need move start mouse position to camera start position:  
``scaler = camera start position - mouse start position``  
So in our example scaler would be equal to ``(0 - 700, 0 - 60) = (-700, -60)``
