# GravityObjectsController.cs
*This class is attached to gravity controller game object*

## Variables
* AllGravityObjects - all gravity objects list

## void AddGravityObject
*Called by new [GravityObject on void Start](https://github.com/mmarusiak/Universe-Simulator/blob/main/Code%20Documentation/Gravity%20Controllers/01.%20GravityObject.cs.md#void-start)*

We are adding new object to the list and then [updating list holders](https://github.com/mmarusiak/Universe-Simulator/blob/main/Code%20Documentation/Gravity%20Controllers/01.%20GravityObject.cs.md#void-updateprivatelist) on each gravity object.

## void GetObjects
*Arguments: gravity object - object not to include in the list*
*Called by gravity object in [updating list holders](https://github.com/mmarusiak/Universe-Simulator/blob/main/Code%20Documentation/Gravity%20Controllers/01.%20GravityObject.cs.md#void-updateprivatelist)*

Returning all gravity objects expect given gravity object (gravity object of caller).

## void PlayPause

*called by [PlayPause void in ButtonsController.cs](../UI%20Controllers/02.%20ButtonsController.cs.md#void-playpause)*

First of all we change isPaused value to opposite of it. Then we're looping thru all gravity objects and setting values which depends by isPaused value. Also if user paused game, we set Velocity value in gravity object to velocity before pause.

## void ResetScene

*called by [PlayPause void in ButtonsController.cs](../UI%20Controllers/02.%20ButtonsController.cs.md#void-resetscene)*

If game isn't paused we [pause it.](./02.%20GravityObjectsController.cs.md#void-playpause) Then we're looping thru all gravity objects to set position of each to startPos and velocity to initial velocity *(we make that because game will be paused and when user will unpause it, velocity will be initial velocity/start velocity).* At the end we reset camera position to ``(0, 0, -10)``
