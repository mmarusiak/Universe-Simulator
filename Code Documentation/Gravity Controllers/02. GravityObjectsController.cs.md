# GravityObjectsController.cs

*This class is attached to gravity controller game object*

## Variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| AllGravityObjects | All gravity objects list, serializefield |
| Reseted | Bool that is true when player hit "reset" button and game is on reseted state |

## void AddGravityObject

*Called by new [GravityObject on void Start](https://github.com/mmarusiak/Universe-Simulator/blob/main/Code%20Documentation/Gravity%20Controllers/01.%20GravityObject.cs.md#void-start)*

We are adding new object to the list and then [updating list holders](https://github.com/mmarusiak/Universe-Simulator/blob/main/Code%20Documentation/Gravity%20Controllers/01.%20GravityObject.cs.md#void-updateprivatelist) on each gravity object.

## void GetObjects

*arguments: gravity object - object not to include in the list*  
*called by gravity object in [updating list holders](https://github.com/mmarusiak/Universe-Simulator/blob/main/Code%20Documentation/Gravity%20Controllers/01.%20GravityObject.cs.md#void-updateprivatelist)*

Returning all gravity objects expect given gravity object (gravity object of caller).

## void PlayPause

*called by [PlayPause void in ButtonsController.cs](../UI%20Controllers/02.%20ButtonsController.cs.md#void-playpause)*

If ``time scale = 0`` we call [UnPause.](./02.%20GravityObjectsController.cs.md#void-unpause) Else we call [Pause](./02.%20GravityObjectsController.cs.md#void-pause)

## void Pause

For now we change only time scale to 0.

## void UnPause

At the start we change only time scale to 1.
Then we change reseted value to 0.

## void ResetScene

*called by [PlayPause void in ButtonsController.cs](../UI%20Controllers/02.%20ButtonsController.cs.md#void-resetscene)*

If game isn't paused we [pause it.](./02.%20GravityObjectsController.cs.md#void-playpause) Then we're looping thru all gravity objects to set position of each to startPos and rigidbody velocity to initial velocity. At the end we reset camera position to ``(0, 0, -10)``

At the end we set reseted value to true.
