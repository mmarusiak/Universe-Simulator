# PlanetLinePath.cs

*This script is attached to each planet to create their path*

## Variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| LinePrefab | Prefab of the segment of the line with LineRenderer on it |
| currentLineHolder | Current instaniate of the LinePrefab |
| currentLineRenderer | LineRenderer component attached to currentLineHolder |
| WaitCount | Float that indicates the time stamp between creating next segments of the line *(in seconds, default value = 0.05)* |
| DrawState | Bool that indicates if we're setting first point of the segment of line or second *(end)* point. If it's false, then we're creating first point, otherwise we're creating second point and finishing whole segment of line |
| ReadyForDraw | Indicates if we can call another draw function *(if we waited the WaitCount value after creating single segment)* |
| _controller | Global [GravityObjectsController](../Gravity%20Controllers/02.%20GravityObjectsController.cs.md) |
| Lines | List of all line created for single planet |

## void Start

Here we're just assigning _controller to global controller.

## void LateUpdate

If game is not paused and we're ready for draw we're changing our ReadyForDraw value to false starting coroutine [DrawLine.](./01.%20%20PlanetLinePath.cs.md#ienumerator-drawline)

## IEnumerator DrawLine

[Picture]

So at the start we're checking if ``DrawState`` is false. If it's then we're creating new base of ``currentLineHolder``, and setting ``currentLineRenderer`` to correct component. We're also disactivating ``currentLineHolder``, because we don't want to see the line when is unfinished *(segment of the line then is weird, because it goes from some planet position to point (0, 0, 0)).* Also we're adding this segment to the ``Lines`` list.  
Then we're setting correct point position to current planet position, changing ``DrawState`` and setting currentLineHolder active value to negative ``DrawState`` *(we're doing it after change of draw state so if we've just created brand new segment, it'll set it to false, otherwise to true)*.  
Next thing is checking if lines are visible, if not we're turning ``currentLineRenderer`` off, so line is not visible and is easier to destroy *(Unity can't find not active game objects, so game object will be still active, but renderer will be off)*.
Then we're waiting ``WaitCount`` and changing ``ReadyForDraw`` value to true.
