# Universe-Simulator

Just a small project for simulate planets and space objects in 2D

## Roadmap:

- [x] **~Refactor~**;
- [x] ~Gravity forces simulation;~
- [x] ~Pause/Play/Reset controls for simulation;~
- [x] ~Player's input controls (scrolling, moving camera and planets);~
- [x] ~User menu/control panel for adding new planets;~
- [x] ~Displaying info window;~
- [x] ~Add tags (velocity and distance);~
- [x] ~Add velocity vectors editor;~
- [x] ~Add pause overlay;~
- [ ] Add settings;
- [x] ~Add save system;~
- [ ] Add community workshop levels/worlds (?);
- [ ] Add logic levels and logic levels creator *(f.e. to beat level you need to reach 400 km/h with given planets, just play with positions)*;
- [ ] Add temperature to planets (?); 
- [ ] Add light to planets - they need to shine (at least some of them)!
- [ ] Add our universe demo in 2D;
- [ ] Explosions (?);


For now you can simulate your own universe. Works fine with orbiting, escaping orbit or colliding. 

If you want to understand code, there is ~[documentation](./Code%20Documentation)~ *(documentation will be finished when project will be done, for now documentation is > 1 month outdated)*.

For now all graphics are just placeholder and I'll eventually change them in future.
