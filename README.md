# Universe-Simulator
Just a small project for simulate planets and space objects in 2D

## Things to add:
* User menu/control panel for adding new planets;
* Light to planets - they need to shine (at least some of them)!
* Our universe demo in 2D;
* Explosions (?);


For now you can simulate your own universe (universe need to be created via unity editor). Works fine with orbiting, escaping orbit or colliding.
