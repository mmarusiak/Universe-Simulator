# Universe-Simulator
Just a small project for simulate planets and space objects in 2D

## Things to add:
User menu/control panel for adding new planets;
Light to planets - they need to shine (at least some of them)!
Our universe demo in 2D;
Explosions (?);


For now you can simulate your own universe (universe need to be created via unity editor). Works fine with orbiting, escaping orbit or colliding.
