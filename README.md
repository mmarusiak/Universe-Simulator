# Universe-Simulator
Just a small project for simulate planets and space objects in 2D


![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20907620/208252336-68b01672-c5dc-40fc-ad2d-7ed273c33fa1.png)


## Things to add:
User menu/control panel for adding new planets;
Light to planets - they need to shine (at least some of them)!
Our universe demo in 2D;
Explosions (?);


For now you can simulate your own universe (universe need to be created via unity editor). Works fine with orbiting, escaping orbit or colliding.
