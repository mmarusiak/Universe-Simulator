# Universe-Simulator

Just a small project for simulate planets and space objects in 2D

## Roadmap:

- [x] Gravity forces simulation;
- [x] Pause/Play/Reset controls for simulation;
- [x] Player's input controls (scrolling, moving camera and planets);
- [x] User menu/control panel for adding new planets;
- [x] Displaying info window;
- [x] Add velocity vectors editor;
- [ ] Add settings;
- [ ] Add save system;
- [ ] Add community levels loader (?);
- [ ] Add temperature to planets (?); 
- [ ] Light to planets - they need to shine (at least some of them)!
- [ ] Our universe demo in 2D;
- [ ] Explosions (?);


For now you can simulate your own universe (universe need to be created via unity editor). Works fine with orbiting, escaping orbit or colliding. 

If you want to understand code, there is [documentation.](./Code%20Documentation)

For now all graphics are just placeholder and I'll eventually change them in future.
